###RAILS BONES!

####Rails Bones is a basic implementation of Backbone.js into a rails backend. Rails Bones is an application for palentologists to more easily track the bones they dig up. Since palentologists are busy and don't have time to wait for pages to refresh we're going to use Backbone to render everything in a single view!
